# Employee Directory

This is a simple employee directory web app built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Vite.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies  
```bash
npm install
npm run dev 

### Freemarker Usage

The project includes a simulated Freemarker template file (`index.ftlh`) where dynamic employee data would be rendered using Freemarker syntax. While no backend is set up, this template demonstrates how data-driven rendering would occur in a real Freemarker environment.
